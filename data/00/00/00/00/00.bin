  |   Armello is a grand swashbuckling adventure that combines three        |
  |   styles of play: the deep tactics of card games with the rich          |
  |   strategy of table top board games, combined with a character          |
  |   role-playing system.                                                  |

  |   As a hero from one of the clans of Armello, you'll quest, scheme,     |
  |   hire agents, explore, vanquish monsters, cast spells and face off     |
  |   against other players, with one ultimate end goal in mind -           |
  |   storming the palace and becoming King or Queen of Armello. The        |
  |   Kingdom of Armello is as dangerous as it is beautiful, perils,        |
  |   banes and bandits hide around every corner and a spreading            |
  |   corruption known as the Rot is leaving no creature untouched.         |
  |                                                                         |

  |   This is our new multiplayer logic overhaul that has been              |
  |   implemented on Steam. It is a behind-the-scenes rework that           |
  |   dramatically improves stability for multiplayer games.                |
  |                                                                         |

  |   We've improved the flow of how we communicate our intentions with     |
  |   the data we collect from your devices. This stuff is important, so    |
  |   please read through the relevant prompts if you get a chance.         |
  |   The TLDR is essentially that we make games and only ever use your     |
  |   data to make the game better.                                         |

  |   Fixed a save game bug, which impacted progress towards achievements   |
  |   and ring/amulet unlocks.                                              |

  |   Fixed a rare NMA (No More Actions softlock) occurring when entering   |
  |   combat with the King.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Fixed a bug when playing a card on a creature that's just about to    |
  |   move would cause the card to be stuck in Waiting.                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Fixed an issue when continuing a saved game a "DLC unowned" error     |
  |   would pop up.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Fixed an issue where the Commendation screen shows the count down     |
  |   timer to be 0 (even though it is counting down, sneaky).              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Fixed an issue where the Commendation screen will still wait for 30   |
  |   seconds even if all other players have left.                          |
